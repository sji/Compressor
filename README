CSS Simple Compressor

Opens a CSS file and removes all the blank lines, and lines that are only comments.
There is a :regex mode which removes all comments (mixed with code as well) and it is possibly faster.

Usage:
require 'lib/compressor'

css_compressor = CSSCompressor.new(filename)
css_compressor.compress_to(destination_filename)

or

css_compressor = CSSCompressor.new(filename, :regex => true)
css_compressor.compress_to(destination_filename)
